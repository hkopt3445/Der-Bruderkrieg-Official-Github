FRENCH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the death of Napoleon III in 1873, Napoleon IV in 1898, Napoleon V in 1926, Napoleon VI took over and promulgated a constitution, more liberal than the previous. Riding high on support gained from this, he has ruled justly and fostered a strong emigre community and a sense of nationalism in the people. After the German Revolution of 1930, France annexed the Rhineland, and the combination of these two factors has made Napoleon VI highly popular. As France gears up for war with the fascists, the Empire of Austria, and the British, Napoleon VI serves as a rallying point for Frenchmen everywhere. Vive la France!"

NAPOELEON_DESC:0 "Napoleon VI, has led an interesting life. Born in Paris in 1914 on the eve of the Europakrieg, his formative years were spent looking at the damage to Europe from that war. His education was interrupted by the death of his father in 1926, causing the regency of the Empress Clementine. His tutor during these years was esteemed liberal politician Gaston Domergue, and after ascending the throne in 1929, Domergue’s influence caused the Emperor to sign the more liberal Constitution of 1927. Shortly after this, Napoleon was shocked when he faced the Rocque Putsch, led by Colonel Francois de la Rocque and right-wing officers opposed to the Constitution. While well respected Field Marshal Phillipe Petain decried the insurrection, he is well known to have sympathy for de la Rocque. Napoleon’s anger knew no bounds when he heard that de la Rocque’s men had shot Domergue, who the Emperor had appointed Prime Minister. The aggrieved Emperor angered Petain by ordering the conspirators to be summarily shot. The loss of Domergue caused Napoleon to retreat from politics and made him question the Constitution he had agreed to, especially after the rise of the SFIO and Radical Party.\n\nThe Emperor’s political hiatus ended in 1933 when, fearing the defeat of Prime Minister Pierre Laval’s government, he personally appealed to the French people to support Laval. The Emperor’s popularity caused a decisive win for Laval, but alienated the Radicals and Socialists to the point where they formed the opppoistion Cartel de Gauche. Extremism heightened, with the Dowager Empress Clementine almost being assassinated by an anarchist. The Emperor wanted to restore the 1852 Constitution, but he was unable to because Edouard Daladier’s left wing of the Doctrinaire threatened to join the Cartel if such a move was taken. Since the withdrawal of the Dynastic Left would destroy the Doctrinaire majority, the Emperor was unable to restore his old powers. Parliament became ever more fractious, with the SFIO radicals on the one hand and the new Mouvement Anticonstitutionaliste et Integraliste, led by a Duumvirate of Charles Maurras and Marcel Bucard, and with ties to Petain. While the Emperor had been infuriated at the Rocque Putsch, he now reconciled with the Marechal, and right wing officers have joined the Emperor’s inner circle. The issue of the refugees has become ever more problematic, with the Emperor officially undecided. Though his tumultuous life and reign had forced him to grow up fast, he is still just 22 and could easily change his position. As the cracks spread in the Empire and in Europe, the Emperor is sure of one thing: the Bonapartes will never surrender."

They had, after all, enforced the Constitution of 1927 upon his father's death, which Napoleon had signed under the influence of the his liberal tutor Domergue. After Domergue's assasination, he had begun his decension into reaction. He dreamed of restoring his great-grandfather Napoleon IV's Constitution of 1852, whic would hand him a huge increase in power. While the Doctrinaire Right supported this action, the Doctrinaire Left under Pierre Laval demanded Napoleon keep the Constitution of 1927; if he refused, then Laval would leave the Doctrinaire coalition and the majority would be lost. It would be quite a risky move to favor the Doctrinaire Right's Policies.\n\nWould he choose to uphold the teachings of his mentor Domerque, or would he succumb to the lust of absolute power?

belgian_election_events.5.t:0 "Belgian Election Campaign Begins!"
belgian_election_events.5.d:0 "The Campaigns have started for the 1936 Belgian Elections! Now for alittle history on Belgium.\n\nBelgium's history is brief, yet complex. In 1830, the Belgian Revolution led to the separation of the Southern Provinces from the Netherlands and to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois, officially French-speaking and neutral, independent Belgium under a provisional government and a national congress. Since the installation of Leopold I as king on 21 July 1831, Belgium has been a constitutional monarchy. The main political parties of the 19th century were the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party. French was originally the single official language adopted by the nobility and the bourgeoisie. However, many people speak Dutch as well.\n\nIt has been under heavy influence from Napoleonic France and Britain; France wants to unite the people of Wallonia under their rule, but the Brits want to secure the Benelux as a place of neutrality in the case of a Prussian invasion from the east, fearing French Ambitions there could disrupt this narrative.\n\nThe 1932 Belgian Elections were extremely controversial, as a well known Integralist Leon Degrelle won. It was not known whether the French Monarchist Supporting Movement Action Francaise intervened, but relations between the French and the British quickly soured. DeGrelle immediately voiced the words of Charles Marras, establishing an integral society. He and Napoleon have been coming close together much to the delight of the Action Francaise and the dismay of the British. Candidate Paul Van Zeeland, a progressive and anti-Degrellist, is supported and funded by Halifax's National Government. Both nations will likely support their favored candidate, and true democracy will likely be sidelined by the great powers. This election will likely decide their fate."

It would be tough, but this election would likely decide the balance of power in Western Europe; DeGrelle must win."

He seemed to be a better fit in the military, one of those tough generals that all the soldiers loved and hated. Then again, he was an incredible speaker. It was no surpise Action Francaise had chosen him as their candidate.\n\n"How are you doing, Emperor? How great it is to meet you!", DeGrelle remarked in a deep voice.\n\n"Napoleon eyed the Press in the distance, snapping picture after picture. He was going to have to handle this situation carefully. Even though the British were busy with their failing empire, they would still hate to see DeGrelle getting too comfy. Then again, this deal would have to be made. The Prussians were expanding fast, and having the Belgians on their side would prove huge difficulties for their armies to move into France, even if they conquered Westfalen.\n\nSo, I get it your Foriegn Minister has told you about our proposal?\n\n"Yes yes he has. And I have thought about it much as well. What do we have to gain from this exactly?"\n\nNapoleon smiled. He had been prepared for this exact question. He went into a long scripted speech about the complex geopolitics of Europe, trade, and more. Towards the end, DeGrelle had begun picking at a scab on his finger, and Napoleon took the cue to cease his lecture.\n\n"Fine, fine, you have convinced me. But I have other matters to attend to. We can talk more tommorrow.\n\nNapoleon gave a sigh of relief. The deed wasn't finished, but he had certainly made progress...at least he thought he had."

Of course he knew that he would accept.\n\n"Our first act will be to build stronger fortifications, on both the Dutch and Westfalen borders. Next I will encourage our investors to invest in your lands." Napoleon continued with other parts of the plan to further convince DeGrelle to what would be his ultimate goal.\n\n"Sounds good. Anything else you have to say?"\n\\nNapoleon knew it was time. But he would need to proceed carefully. 70 years ago, his ancestor Napoleon III had purchased Luxembourg from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Now he would be proposing a similar deal to DeGrelle. But it was risky. If the French Buffer State was to be formed, the British would be pissed off. Big time. Napoleon knew he had to..."

francestart.1.t:0 "Announcing Imperial Elections"
francestart.1.d:0 "With the country and the Chambers bitterly divided over the question of refugee citizenship, the Emperor has opted to step in and call for new elections. With luck the new chambers will solve the problem in a level headed manner, hopefully things don’t get too out of hand. " 
francestart.1.a:0 "Election Season is upon us"

francestart.13.t:0 "The Campaign Begins"
francestart.13.d:0 "The two main electoral blocs are the Doctrinaires, a broad group of nationalist constitutional monarchists dedicated to order, and the Leftist Coalition, a coalition of the Radical Party, a liberal party with mainly constitutionalist tendencies, though hosting a strong republican minority, and the SFIO, a socialist trade union that while not strictly a party, holds enormous power. The citizens of France must decide the future of the nation, but going too far to the right or left might result in catastrophe for the country. Btw Doctrinaires are led by Laval, Radicals by Daladier, and SFIO by Blum."
francestart.13.a:0 "A Fierece Competition"

francestart.2.t:0 "The Issue of Refugees"
francestart.2.d:0 "France's Refugee Issue is a complex situation made up of four main groups: Poles, Italians, Hungarians, and Prussians; \nPolish Legions are hardcore soldiers (and families) who are personally loyal to the Bonaparte dynasty but somewhat liberal (constitutionalists); they dislike Prussian exiles, are neutral towards Italian liberals, and have a love-hate relationship with Hungarian revolutionaries.\nPrussian exiles, mostly conservative officers, are loyal to the Doctrinaire party, but despise Poles, Italian liberals and are moderate against Hungarian revolutionaries.\nItalian liberals, most of them are officially liberals though some are secretly anarchists, are sympathetic to liberal republicans and the SFIO; They support Hungarians, dislike Prussians, and are neutral towards Poles.\nHungarian revolutionaries, across the ideological spectrum but generally social democrats aligned with the Leftist Coalition, are fiercely committed to self-determination for all nations; they have a love-hate relationship with the Polish exiles (liberal nationalist brothers and historical friendship, but ideological divergences), support the Italian liberals, and are moderately against Prussian exiles."
francestart.2.a:0 "We Must Choose A Side"

francestart.3.t:0 "The Refugee Bill was rejected"
francestart.3.d:0 "Today, Napoleon walked outside of the Imperial Senate building in Paris and announced that the Refugee Bill to give voting rights to the Hungarians and Italians was struck down. This likely means that the Doctrinaires will prevail in Imperial Elections, with mainly French Conservatives participating."
francestart.3.a:0 "No Civil Rights? Based."

francestart.4.t:0 "The Refugee Bill was accepted"
francestart.4.d:0 "Today, Napoleon walked outside of the Imperial Senate building in Paris and announced that the Refugee Bill to give voting rights to the Hungarians and Italians was accepted by the Senate. This likely means that the Popular Front will prevail in Imperial Elections, with huge surge of SS Leftist Members allowed to vote."
francestart.4.a:0 "Civil Rights? Based."

francestart.5.t:0 "Napoleon Denounces the Left"
francestart.5.d:0 "Napoleon had just finished giving a speech on why France should elect Charles Maurras as mayor of Paris.\n\nIn an unprecedented move for an emperor he had officially denounced the SFIO, calling them terrorists and Jacobins, and has pleaded with the people of France to reject them. By extension he is supporting the Doctrinaire forces against the Leftist Coalition. This has outraged many among the left and even liberal reformists are annoyed at Imperial interference, but Imperial popularity has weakened leftist support. "
francestart.5.a:0 "The Doctrinaires must win!"

francestart.6.t:0 "Napoleon Visits Factories"
francestart.6.d:0 "The Emperor has taken a tour of the Paris factories. He was visibly appalled by the condition of the workers and gave many of them francs, earning him looks of gratitude. The Emperor asked what he could do for them, and was asked to lower their work hours. Before Napoleon could respond, his aide, friends with a wealthy factory owner, hissed in his ear, "The business classes support you, my Emperor. I trust you won’t give in to these preposterous demands?" The Emperor, left in a dilemma, turned to the expectant workers and made some bland promises about future wage increases."
francestart.6.a:0 "Maybe this will stop the strikes...?"

francestart.14.t:0 "Fire In Their Bellies"
francestart.14.d:0  "The workers did not take kindly to the Emperor’s answer. They fulminated, spreading the word of his callous disregard for their plight. One day, it blew over. Tens of thousands of workers took to the streets, denouncing capitalism as oppressive and murderous. The workers are flocking to the SFIO by the thousands. The Emperor looks on in anguish and regret as the Doctrinaire majority looks ever slimmer. "
francestart.14.a:0 "We Cannot Live on Cake!"


francestart.7.t:0 "Operation Savior"
francestart.7.d:0 ""Thank you, my Emperor," Petain said, smiling. "You will not regret this." The Emperor already had his doubts - what if Petain overthrew democracy entirely? - but he was committed now. Petain’s headquarters at Metz were a flurry of activity for several days as conservative officers prepared for a potential civil war. The Emperor made a "troop review" to see for himself the preparations for "war", and what he saw reassured him. Operation Savior was ready.\n\nThe Next Day, with the army at his side, Napoleon forced a decree through parliament increasing his power to essentially prevent the Jacobins from wining. The workers were getting more and more mad."
francestart.7.a:0 "Order over Liberty. Napoleon Rules All!"

France was interested in owning us  as a way to launch a possible incursion into the rest of Germany to restore Napoleonic hegemony over Germany and to recreate the Confederation of the Rhine to show French domination over central Europe and to rival Austria further. They quickly built a strong presence, but it would come to hurt them in the future.\n\nCommunism was spreading to industrialized countries specifically, and was becoming a problem in France with the creation of the “Parti de la liberté des Travailleurs, a radical socialist revolutionary communist party which had taken part in multiple terrorist attacks and bombings against Right-Wing groups. With growing French resentment of the Left, France would watch as far-leftists would do the unthinkable in ourlands, using their positions in the government to launch a coup and hold the King, Karl Josef Bonaparte, a member of Napoleon’s family hostage. The subsequent Napoleonic invasion led to the rise of Lord Regent Charles De Gaulle, who has installed a strict law code known as "Neue Code Napoleon".\n\nThe reformed Code Napoleon is very enlightened and has helped stabilize us, but has caused a fervent rise in opposition to De Gaulle and the King's rule."
