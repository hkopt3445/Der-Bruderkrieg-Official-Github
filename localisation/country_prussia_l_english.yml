GORING_DESC:0 "Hermann Goering was born in a world of German nationalism, in 1893 in Magdeburg, Prussia. His father, Heinrich, had been exiled for "betraying" the Confederation. In his childhood, he first read and became fascinated with the Teutonic mythos, encouraged by his father. He enlisted in the Prussian army at age 16, finding a country unrecognizable to his youth after the Volkisch takeover. While he was inspired by the Teutonic assertiveness of the Volkisch occultists, he would soon begin to wonder how it fit in, practically speaking, with the great project of German unification.\n\nEverything changed for Goering when the Europakrieg started. He served bravely at the Battle of Krakow, and his political leanings and skill led to his quick promotion. When the Luftstreitkrafte, the Prussian air force, was formed, Goering joined the service and was a natural. By the end of the war, Goering was third-in-command of the Luftstreitkrafte. Although his promotions were largely a result of his Volkisch loyalty, the failure to unite Germany had soured Goering on the Volkisch, who he scorned as occultists who lacked the strength of will to unite the German people. As the post-war malaise set in, Goering joined a new military organization, the German National Social Front. When the organization was outlawed, Goering protected the paramilitary head of the Sturmabeiltung, Ernst Rohm.\n\nDespite his differences with the Volkisch and the reactionary veterans of the Freikorps, Goering joined with them when Rosa Luxemburg and the Spartacist movement staged the Revolution of 1930. Goering, now the head of the Luftwaffe, was an advocate of brutal suppression. But with the Wehrmacht decimated, the SA and Freikorps were now the main force against the Spartacists. When the Spartacists were crushed as an organized force, Goering struck. Convincing the Freikorps that the defense of Prussia and Germany required the ouster of the Volkisch regime, Rohm and Mackensen launched Operation Kolibri, overthrowing the Volkisch. The scars of the strife remain, though, and with Germany dominated by paramilitaries, his government is shakier than he’d like to admit. it remains to be seen if he can be the "Greatest of the Germans," or even the new Charlemagne."

Many tried to save Germany from the corrupt princes but were stopped by the greatest traitors, Austria.

They must die for Germany to live, down with the traitors, up with the eagle!"

GER_Clash_Of_The_Militias_desc:0 "The militias of the Anti-Spartacist alliance have become staunch rivals. The Sturmabeiltung, our personal militia, have expanded massively since Operation Hummingbird. The increasingly radical leader of the SA, Ernst Rohm, is advocating the destruction of all "medieval" structures and the establishment of a Futurist, Spartan state. This view has made them increasingly rowdy, rapacious, and worst, disloyal to the Reichsmarshall. Rohm especially is becoming a major threat.\n\nThe second problem is the Freikorps. Formed as a reactionary, nationalist organization in the wake of Luxemburg's abortive revolution, they fought side by side with the Wehrmacht and SA against her partisans. After the death of their political supporters in Operation Hummingbird, they were theoretically integrated with the Wehrmacht, but their reactionary, Volkisch nature was maintained. Led by August von Mackensen, they are on the outs with the regime but might be persuaded to rally it - if the SA are removed. While the SA think of the Freikorps as reactionary traitors - and they may be, given the recent Fuhrerdammerung - the Freikorps consider the SA lowborn wretches as bad as the Spartacists. What's more, the Freikorps has strong Wehrmacht support, and angering one will anger the other."

They promised a great Germany, restoring the glory we had during the fall of the Roman Empire. Together with the descendants of Rome, we fought the traitors, to reclaim Germany. But they failed us. We were betrayed by our allies, but also betrayed by the Volkisch, who lacked the will to see the deed done. Nevertheless, the Reichsmarshall’s followers allowed the Volkisch to persist, and supported them when Luxemburg’s criminal reds tried to run Germany into the ground. But after the reds were broken, the Volkisch were a liability to Germany. Their leaders were granted the dignity of being shot, their organizations broken and exiled. \n\n The Volkisch mostly seem to have good intentions, even if they lack the ability to fight in the best way for Germany, being overly focused on pagan pursuits that distract from unification. We will likely be able to reconcile with most of them, invite them back to Germany, and put them to work energizing the nation, though they will have to be watched of course. But they are a threat with significant popular following, and reactionary elements among the Wehrmacht and Freikorps despise them. An alternative answer, therefore, is allowing the Protestant Church, who the Volkisch suppressed, a role subordinate to the state in German life. The values of discipline and honesty may be more natural to many Germans than the Nordicist beliefs of the Volkisch. Which faction should we back?"

It was something of a disappointment when he stepped off along with the Abwehr chief, Wilhelm Canaris. Mussolini, wearing his trademark eagle cap, walked up to them. "Buongiorno, Signore Goering!" Goering inwardly seethed: this Italian had the nerve to make the translator do work? But he checked himself, Mussolini after all had been the Vaterland’s one faithful ally for all these years. Canaris saluted Mussolini, and in they went. \n\nMussolini said, "Let’s get down to business," and in came a Italian general. "General Badoglio, Herr Goering," he said, casting Mussolini a glance of utter loathing that Goering was sure the Duce didn’t see. So he’s a traditionalist, Goering thought, but at least he had the decency to call me Herr. Canaris and Badoglio began to explain the plan. "Our current contacts," said Canaris, "are a group known as the Associazione Nationalista Italiana, or the ANI. They are a group with long contacts to the Duce, working to subvert both the Austrians and the mad anarchists." Goering chuckled. He had heard Canaris’ rants about the anarchists from Young Italy and couldn’t believe it, how could a bunch of fools and fanatics ever hope to destroy Austria without even a government? Badoglio, picking up on this, said, "Herr Goering, I know it is hard to believe but the anarchists are so popular that they are almost as great a threat as the Austrians, and certainly stronger than our allies. If you don’t believe me, look at the Spartacists." The point hit home, Goering knew better than most that fooling people was an easy business. \n\n"What is your plan, Signore?" he asked. Badoglio replied, "At the predetermined moment, ANI insurgencies will begin across the countryside. Ideally they should tie down the Austrian armies, allowing us to break their line and relieve the ANI rebels. Once the Austrian defences break, perhaps they will be forced to retreat, and it will be the beginning of the end." Neither officer looked optimistic about the latter statement, but Mussolini looked very pleased. "See, Reichsmarshall?" he exclaimed excitedly. "We will break the Austrians with a swift blow, and then revenge shall be ours! \n\n"Thank you, Duce, but what is our role in all this?" Canaris replied. "We are to supply guns and ammunition, as well as launch a simultaneous attack to ensure that the Italian positions cannot be reinforced by Austria." Goering thought about this. He knew the generals had complained about sending equipment to their allies. And he knew that many German soldiers were unable to fight effectively for lack of weapons. But on the off chance that the plan worked, he had to try it. Anything less would anger the Italian allies, who had remained loyal. "Alright, that sounds good. What we need most, though, is a name.

He had crushed Austria, the parasitic false German state that had stood in the way of the eagle’s ascendance. Only the Slavs remained, and surely they would not prove a threat, backwards and incompetent as they were. The red threat had been swept from the continent, and their loyal allies in Rome held the Mediterranean in their grasp. Britain could pose no threat to the hegemony realistically.\n\nStill he wondered, what would he do? The German people hailed him as a saviour. This ceremony was about crowning him the new Karl, which, he smugly admitted to himself, was not inaccurate. But would they want another war? And, barring the abhorrent possibility of the Volkisch being correct, he would die eventually. If he died, would Germany descend into anarchy? And how long could the hegemony last?\n\nHe brushed aside these thoughts. The hegemony, with true Germans in charge, would last for 1000 years. Of course it would. And he would appoint his successor at some point, it wasn’t like he was going to die anytime soon. He decided to stop thinking.

The lands of the west, our old brothers in France and our traitor brothers in Austria, still resist the will of Germany! We must never allow this, we must break them! The lands of the east, where the great Slavic enemy resides! Home of liberalism now! They must submit, and our birthright must be whole! Stand up, soldiers! Stand up, workers and wives!

This view has made them increasingly rowdy, rapacious, and worst, disloyal to the Reichsmarshall. Rohm especially is becoming a major threat.\n The second problem is the Freikorps. Formed as a reactionary, nationalist organization in the wake of Luxemburg's abortive revolution, they fought side by side with the Wehrmacht and SA against her partisans. After the death of their political supporters in Operation Hummingbird, they were theoretically integrated with the Wehrmacht, but their reactionary, Volkisch nature was maintained. Led by August von Mackensen, they are on the outs with the regime but might be persuaded to really it - if the SA are removed. While the SA think of the Freikorps as reactionary traitors - and they may be, given the recent Fuhrerdammerung - the Freikorps consider the SA lowborn wretches as bad as the Spartacists. What's more, the Freikorps has strong Wehrmacht support, and angering one will anger the other. \n Waiting will only anger both, so we must destroy one to appease the other. Herr Reichsmarshall, who shall we destroy?"
