 KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky is the quintessential radical democrat. Having joined the republican-leaning left wing Turdoviks, he moderated his tone after the Tsar gave the Duma significant power, deciding that a powerless Tsar was no different than not having one. With the rise of the Workers Movement, support for Kerensky, a social democrat, grew, and he won election to the prime ministership in the VI State Duma. He has been in this office since, making Russia into a republic in all but name and preventing a Bolshevik takeover. His government, comprised of liberal and social democrats has held together, but has become increasingly divided over the future of Russia. Kerensky’s support has dwindled in free-market liberal circles for his social programs, and it remains to be seen whether his ideal of a democratic republic for the people will stand the test of time."

 PAVEL_DESC:0 "Pavel Milyukov is the leader of Russia's 2nd most powerful, popular and largest party in all of Russia, the Constitutional Democratic Party. He is a firm believer in a people first, and more controversially, a Greater Russian idea. Being a Russian irredentist, Milyukov gains much leniency from the Black Hundreds, spared from their brutal wrath in Ukraine and Russia. Though Milyukov is a firm critic of the government and the staunch ultranationalism of the Black Hundredists, he himself still believes in the democratic process unlike some of his more skeptical opponents, those being Lenin and Trotsky especially. Despite this, Milyukov's democratic ideals and slight market-liberalism allows for his ability to grow the CDP's popularity amongst the people further, and especially among the free marketists within Russia's politics, as of their anti-Kerensky stance. Milyukov will continue to rise, and now as President, will lead Russia into a golden age of dominance and prosperity, right?"

BELOGUROV_DESC:0 "Nikolai Belogurov, the leader of the Right-Wing URP coalition, is a staunch Russian nationalist, Monarchist and, very very controversially, Orthodox Conservative and quite pro-despotism. Despite this, Belogurov has expressed he believes in the democratic system (to a certain extent), as well as espousing Russian ultranationalist beliefs and the belief in Russian spiritualism and the outlawing of anything deemed degenerate by the church and Tsar. Belogurov, though previously being a Russian noble and violent Tsarist, has reformed his party into a semi-democratic coalition, reforming the URP's doctrines and revoking his under the table deals and alliances with groups that are considered being near terrorist organizations, more so the Okhrana remnants and Balck Hundredists. Belogurov's rise in power and wash over of Right-Wing nationalism suprised much of Russia, but with his newly found strong supporter base, has been able to garner the Presidency, though by a slim margin, will continue to lead Russia for the next term, or maybe, that term will never come as critics state, calling him a despot, monarchist puppet. Nevertheless, Belogurov definitely has something in store for Russia.."

LENIN_DESC:0 "Vladmir Lenin is the envy of all those radical among the left. He stands as a pillar of pro-Working Class, anti-establishment and leftist doctrine. Having been one of the original members of the RSDLP during his voluntary exile, is one of the most powerful figures of the RSDLP, and is inching towards the near tear in the RSDLP. His position of attempting total dominance over the RSDLP has led him to being viewed as a power hungry figure by many, and has always been a firm critic of the monarchy, Kerensky, and all parties that of his own, and especially his rival to control over the RSDLP, Tsereteli. For now, the RSDLP remains unified, but it's quite possible a tear could be caused soon. Lenin is an incredibly smart fellow among Russian politicans, but his populist motives and anti-government sentiment has set him back among upper class officials and many factory workers fed up with larger parties lying directly to the workers. Lenin, however, is ready to lead Russia into a brighter, more red future."

 RUSSIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1878, we Russians helped our Orthodox brethren liberate themselves from Ottoman tyranny. But the failures of the Tsar to win the Eastern War caused a Revolution in 1905. The Constitution of 1905 effectively surrendered most of the Tsar’s power, included labor rights, and ensured democracy. Russian politics have been pretty harmonious, and the East, not the West, is now the bastion of democracy. Long live Russia, united and free!"

The rising instability and political radicalization has allowed conflict between ethnic groups fester under the skin of the Republic.\n\nThe ethnic conflict occurs mostly in Eastern Ukraine, between Ukrainian Militias and Novorossiyan Militias fighting for control over land and committing acts of terrorism including bombings, massacres and assassinating government officials in support of either group. In addition, Byelorussians are in conflict over land in the Baltic Confederation, with Lithuanians who make up a small minority within Byelorussia. They have seen themselves to be subject to brutal pogroms, killings and lynchings of the 'disgusting' and 'heretical Lithuanian catholics'.

He has also enacted strict prohibitionist and anti-corruption policies. Lenin and Tsereteli are very close to tearing the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, RSDLP, in half in their tug of war for direct control over the RSDLP coalition member parties.

More and more conservatives join the ranks and the ranks of the officers, creating a political conflict in the army. Politicians have been fiercely debating about the situation in the army for years now, as many in the Left-Wing believe the conservatives in the army a threat to Russian democracy, the Republic, and the government.

SOV_starting_events.1.t:0 "A Chaotic Republic"
SOV_starting_events.1.d:0 "Russia's political spectrum is composed of many contrasting sides.\n\nThe Democratic left of Russia, being mostly dominated by Social Democrats, Liberals and Centre-Left groups. Many of these groups seek to preserve the Russian democracy as is, and some seek radical reform in an attempt to socialize and revitalize the country. Most leftists support the Trudovik Party and the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), despite the party having no real leadership and the 2 main candidates for President being both Lenin and Tsereteli. These lot are much more popular than the followers of Marx and Trotsky, and the Conservatives and the Russonationalists of the Russian alt-right. If we choose to support the democratic groups of the left we will have a choice between the three major parties of the left. The Social Democrats that are the Trudoviks, or "Martov Worshippers" as referred to by opposition parties. The Constitutional Democratic Party, are those who support a democracy close to the democracy of Great Britain, a liberalist consitutional democracy where the royalty are nothing but figureheads. And the RSDLP, being heavy prohibitionists and supporters of an industrialized Russia and an industrialized Siberia, wanting radical economic and social change as well as a reconstruction of the military's systems and policies put in place by Kerensky and the President before him, Martov.\n\nThen we have the democratic right, with the United Orthodox Conservative Front (UOCF), and many other much smaller parties, forming the bulk of the democratic Russian right wing groups, or possibly the more progressive traditionalist group, the Pravaya Svoboda (Right Liberty, PS) a more libertarian and republican party, supporting the rights of Russians, yet have some anti-Ukrainian sentiment, but seem to be on the good side of the Don and Kubanian cossacks. Or possibly the much more radicalist Right Wing, the Black Hundredists who believe in empowering the Russian monarchy and forming a fascist Russocentric, anti-Ukrainian and anti-Semetism, by far the largest of the Radicalist and Right Wing groups, having fought on Khreshchatyk against the Bolsheviks and RSDLP, resulting in a heavy victory for their assault divisions and armed wings, with many Bolsheviks being stabbed or killed.\n\nWhich will we choose?"

The Tsar would slowly be given power over politics of Russia. Starting with an increased influence over the Parliament and eventually restoring Autocratic Rule. This is a move, so that the Tsar’s image is not tarnished. The Tsar, having no other option, agreed with Belugorov and now, when he offered vodka to the Politician, he gladly accepted.

"Listen up, Vladimir, you deal with the bottom floor, do not shoot ANYONE, and Irkirov, you deal help me find him, but the same applies to you." When they reached the outskirts of the building, they busted in. "HANDS UP AND SURRENDER TO US AND NO ONE WILL BE HURT!" Sergey screamed as he shot his pistol on the ceiling. Vladimir went to evacuate all personnels out, and Irkirov and Sergey rushed to the first floor, where they frantically searched all doors, evacuating the staff in the process. Eventually, they found a room labelled, "Chairman’s Office" they busted in and saw Trotsky putting a revolver inside you mouth. "OH NO YOU DON’T" as Sergey rushed forward and knocked the pistol out of his hand. He signalled for Irkirov to evacuate the rest of the staff which he proceeded to do. Trotsky shouted, "KILL ME, DON'T TAKE ME THERE, I BEG YOU" "The Tsar wants you alive, and he shall have that!" as he knocked out Trotsky. He handcuffed the man and proceeded to exit the building. He saw the whole staff outside, without a single casualty. "You both have done well, I will be sure to get you both a promotion!" Both of them shared a smile and all three of them boarded her horses. However, the only thing going on in Sergey’s mind was, how many sleepless nights will he experience now? He only begged that the Lord would forgive him for this."

For many years, the Tsar had been living in his personal estate at Peterhof, but now, with the victory of the Union of Russian People’s Party in the VII Duma Elections, he was once again called back to the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg.  There, Belogurov and other high ranking members of the Party were waiting for him. When he entered the palace, a feeling of both nostalgia and solace overtook his mind. For a very long time, he had missed the interior of the Palace. He had ignored the intricate patterns on the wall for quite some time. Now, he was paying attention to every little intricate detail. When he reached the Podium, Belogurov handed him the crown, and in a small little speech he made, he granted back the Tsar, all of the formal titles, he held previously, The Tsar of All Russia and the King of Finland, and he was overjoyed to again hear the cries of "Long Live the Tsar" by the people. He and his family were all invited back to the Palace and a huge party was thrown by the members of the URP."

SOV_return_of_the_tsar_path.12.d:0 "It was very early in the morning. Only the Early Birds were able to witness the Tsar’s carriage making its way to the podium which had been recently constructed. On the streets, the Tsar saw many people, starving, homeless. He did not think much about them though, the streets of Moscow had always been like that. When he reached the Podium, the Tsar was greeted by Belogurov and other members of the URP. After two hours, the preparations for the speech were over and the podium was surrounded by tens of thousands of people. The Tsar, along with Belugorov stepped onto the Podium and the Tsar raised his hand to signify silence.\n\n"A Long while back, The Russian Nation achieved victory against the Swedes, in the Great Northern War. That moment was considered Russia’s ascension to one of the Great Powers. Any calculations of European Politics would be incomplete without factoring the Empire of Russia. Catherine the Great, brought Stability and the Golden Era to Russia and Tsar Alexander I made it all the way to Paris, bringing the mighty Napoleonic Empire down. From these, it is quite evident that the Dynasty of Romanov was responsible for Russia’s glory. However, after the Republic took charge in Russia, it was as if we were facing humiliation one after the other, after the other. These series of humiliations will end today. The Autocratic Rule of the Tsar will be restored in Russia, however, the Duma will not cease to exist. I am sure that this move will be beneficial for Russia and I will try my hardest to get Russia back on its track! The Empire of Russia is reborn!"\n\nThis speech was met with thunderous applause and cheers of "Long Live the Tsar" This move by the Tsar and the URP Members, may very well cause some general unrest, but the Restoration of the Autocracy will surely show its true potential once Russia faces a question to its glory again!"

SOV_pavel_tree_events.1.t:0 "The Question of the Okhrana"
SOV_pavel_tree_events.1.d:0 "The date was September 18th, 1911. Pytor Stolyplin walked outside of the Kiyv Opera House with his wife after a riveting show of Tchiakovsky's Nutcracker. Little did he know these would be his last steps; outside stood Dmitry Bogrov, a proponent of violent revolution who acted simultaneously as a member of the Tsar's Secret Service, the Okhrana. Bogrov would fire the shot heard around the whole of Russia.\n\nAfter Stolyplin's assasination, Former President Martov cracked down on the Okhrana, with President Kerensky finally banning it once and for all. While the Okhrana was not completely destroyed after Kerensky's ban, it would remain in a state of deep division. Dmitry Bogrov had escaped from his prison cell and was now one of the leaders of the Okhrana, the head of the Savages Faction; Yegor Ivanka headed the Gallows faction, while many other smaller factions were scattered around the fringes of Russia. On the 31st of October 1923, the Gallowe Ball was called on an estate in Siberia by the leaders in hopes of solving the schism; however, in a shocking turn of events, Bogrov and his Savages assasinated the Gallows and other enemies. Bogrov himself disappeared after the ball, leaving many to believe he had been assasinated himself.\n\nAfter the ball, the Okhrana became a disorganized mess with no real leadership. That leads us to the present day. With the highly unstable situation of our nation, President Milyukov could use a powerful Okhrana to secure his rule...but at the cost of democracy. Recent intelligence shows Bogrov might be alive in hiding somewhere in Europe, and he might be the only hope for creating a powerful Okhrana once again.\n\nThe Duma is voting whether to allow the limited rearment of the Okhrana. Now we must choose what path we should take: should we unleash the beast over Russia, or preserve the democratic ideals that brought us our presidency?"

My homeland is currently under attack by the Japanese, and thousands of men are dying everyday just to protect their fatherland. The Empire of Japan may have also been eyeing up US Territory in the Pacific. It is of utmost importance that we curb the influence of this evil empire. So, I request you, not as an Ambassador, but as a Russian whose nation is under attack, please assist us. I hope that you understand, and even small shipments of weapons will be beneficial to us. We will make sure to repay the glorious American Nation from what we can. Thankyou. -Signed, Boris Bakhmeteff''\nThe President walked to his room in the White House and he began to think about it.

 TRB_turkish_minority_desc:0 "Since the founding of our great state, many have criticised our regime, calling us a fake Greek state, and claiming we are nothing but Russian bootlickers. Most of which have been the Turkish groups in our nation, mostly based in Samsunta and even our capital, Trebizond. But, they've been rapidly filing out as they had once made up half of our nation's population. Still, there is a small amount of them still left, making up a minority of our population, who continue to criticize us. We have been keeping them quiet for now with occasional nationalist rally, and the political suppression of Turkish nationalist parties, but this still takes up a portion of our funds. Some have even taken to the streets to resist our rule, but most of which have been shunned and some assaulted by Pontic Greek nationalists supporting a second Trapzuntine Empire."

 TRB_safehaven_for_greeks_desc:0 "The Trapzuntine State has been open to the Greeks who had been under oppression in West and South-Western Anatolia by the Ottoman dogs. Many of them have flocked to our country seeking work and protection from the Turkish nationalist groups and Ottoman armies who trample our shared homeland and slaughter our people. This has actually been anything but a burden, as our widely popular Greek ethnic nationalist groups have announced the support for our state due to our willingness to take in Greeks fleeing political oppression within Anatolia, and has bolstered our workforce with new young Greeks, seeking asylum!"

We must overcome this imbeciles and help bring our state to true glory, to shove it into the face of those idiotic people! Yet, their opinion of us being a puppet state is in fact true, we must attempt to resist Russian influence in our government if we wish for true independence, but at least try to reconcile relations if our relations are hurt by this."

 TRB_weak_economy:0 "Weak Economy"
 TRB_weak_economy_desc:0 "Ever since the stock market crash in Vienna, our economy has been weakened, but, our nation fears not as we have a rising workforce and employment rate, as thousands of Greeks in Turkish occupied Anatolia flood into our nation looking for work, most of them with skills in the trades, bringing children and their families for better lives in our genocide free state! Long live Trebizond!"

It is questionable that trying to wipe out their presence in the RSDLP would represent an immense mistake. Instead of undermining their existence in the party, it is for our shared interest that we should try to negotiate with the leaders of the Tsertelli and try to find a common ground between our policies. Undeniably some compromises with our methods will be required to do so, but it is a sacrifice that we are ready to make."
