  LONG_DESC:0 "Huey 'The Kingfish' Long was at one point a nobody from the rural town of Winnfield about 200 miles northwest of Baton Rouge. But Long didn't stay a nobody forever and very quickly became a well known figure in Louisiana. After attending university he became a skilled and well known lawyer who was known for never taking a case against the poor man.Long’s law skills even caught the attention of WIlliam Howard Taft who said Long was 'the most brilliant lawyer who ever practiced before the United States Supreme Court.' His time as a lawyer saw the beginning of his never ending battle against the Standard oil company of Louisiana. Long was elected to "chair of the Louisiana public service commision' in 1922. In 1924 Long unsuccessfully ran for governor of Louisiana, although he became more well known and would still play a key role in the state's politics. In 1928 Long ran again with the slogan 'Every man a king' and won with the largest voter margin in Louisiana till that point. Long's leadership transformed the once isolated swamp communities of Louisiana to bustling towns connected with real paved roads. Long’s policies of helping the common man boosted him to national stardom.\nLong was governor until 1932. In 1932 Long ran against FDR for the democrat nominee. The race was close but a week before the democratic convention of 1932 an affair FDR was in with a woman was published in the newspaper with photo evidence. Over the previous months FDR’s polio had become worse and was now noticed by the public. This led to Long securing the nomination in a very close 52% win. Long easily beat incumbent President Herbert Hoover winning 58% of the popular vote or 22,377,868 votes  out of the 38,582,531 voters that year. Long won 409 of 531 electoral college votes. Long has since tried to pass multiple massive public relief bills and programs but has experienced fierce resistance from congress. Long’s battle with Standard Oil still continues and despite his best efforts the nation is on fire, battling a polio outbreak, a bad economy and an upcoming election. The 1936 election will decide the fate of Huey Long and America."

Now they control the states through spies, guerillas, and interventions, having the big stick ready to strike at us again.

Most Americans are out of a job, struggling to make ends meet and close to starvation. Long was elected on his policy of economic aid, rural investment and public works programs. Here in 1936 Long is finally making progress in his breakthrough to implement his policies 4 years after his election. With new candidates racing in support of different policies such as William Borah’s Coolidge-esque de-regulation policies and Al Smith’s anti New Deal approach this election will decide how the economy of America could be changed forever. With it having been 20 years since the beginning of the depression many presidents have tried to solve the problem. So far none have succeeded. "

Only a couple days after his big speech, the first of his reelection campaign, Democratic Party leaders who had once clashed with Long over his rivalry with consertatives and the late Franklin Delano Roosevelt were now throwing their full support behind Long. The Democratic Party had been split into 3 factions during the decisive 1932 elections: the Smith Faction, the Roosvelelt Faction, and the Longist faction. Due to the lasting impacts of the Great Depression and FDR's scandals, Huey had won the initially close primary in a blowout. He had recieved scorn from the likes of Harry Byrd and John Nance Garner. But today, he picked up today's New York Times, the major headline being, "Garner endorses the Kingfish!"\n\nLong put down the phone and got up to go get dressed. He would continue to campaign today in the primaries against Al Smith, but he knew his winning the primary would be far easier with the support of the Roosevelts. Now, it was time to move forward."

But after Wallace tried to pass the bill in Congress it was clear that even if congress Would fully support all stages of the bill, the treasury does not have the spare funds to allow all 3 stages of the bill to pass. Wallace must now choose between building roads connecting the forgotten communities, giving seeds to farmers to continue farming that would otherwise not be able to afford them, or establishing food distribution centers to feed starving families."

 USA_the_banana_war_desc:0 "The United Fruit Company was formed with the merger of Minor C. Keith's banana-trading and Andrew W. Preston's Boston Fruit Company. It has slowly been gaining land in Central America and has been gaining more and more influence in the state. Yet the current Sandinista leader has been reluctant to let them play a bigger role, so it is our job to make sure the people know of the clear benefits of United Fruit investment. With Central American Elections coming up soon, we hope to get our candidate Francisco Javier Arana in power.\n\nCurrently, our influence in Centro-American politics is §Y[?CEN_USA_Influence]§! out of 1000.\n\n§CIf we secure a high enough influence, our candidate will be elected and we will control all Central American activities.§!"
