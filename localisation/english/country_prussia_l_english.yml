GOeRING_DESC:0 "Hermann Goering was born in a world of German nationalism, in 1893 in Magdeburg, Prussia. His father, Heinrich, had been exiled for "betraying" the Confederation. In his childhood, he first read and became fascinated with the Teutonic mythos, encouraged by his father. He enlisted in the Prussian army at age 16, finding a country unrecognizable to his youth after the Volkisch takeover. While he was inspired by the Teutonic assertiveness of the Volkisch occultists, he would soon begin to wonder how it fit in, practically speaking, with the great project of German unification.\n\nEverything changed for Goering when the Europakrieg started. He served bravely at the Battle of Krakow, and his political leanings and skill led to his quick promotion. When the Luftstreitkrafte, the Prussian air force, was formed, Goering joined the service and was a natural. By the end of the war, Goering was third-in-command of the Luftstreitkrafte. Although his promotions were largely a result of his Volkisch loyalty, the failure to unite Germany had soured Goering on the Volkisch, who he scorned as occultists who lacked the strength of will to unite the German people. As the post-war malaise set in, Goering joined a new military organization, the German National Social Front. When the organization was outlawed, Goering protected the paramilitary head of the Sturmabeiltung, Ernst Rohm.\n\nDespite his differences with the Volkisch and the reactionary veterans of the Freikorps, Goering joined with them when Rosa Luxemburg and the Spartacist movement staged the Revolution of 1930. Goering, now the head of the Luftwaffe, was an advocate of brutal suppression. But with the Wehrmacht decimated, the SA and Freikorps were now the main force against the Spartacists. When the Spartacists were crushed as an organized force, Goering struck. Convincing the Freikorps that the defense of Prussia and Germany required the ouster of the Volkisch regime, Rohm and Mackensen launched Unternehmen Kolibri, overthrowing the Volkisch. The scars of the strife remain, though, and with Germany dominated by paramilitaries, his government is shakier than he'd like to admit. it remains to be seen if he can be the "Greatest of the Germans," or even the new Charlemagne."

Before the Europakrieg in 1914, we forged alliances with Russia and Italy to fight Austria, yet the war was a minor victory. The next decades would prove tumultuous for the Volkisch, with the Spartakist scum attemping a communist revolution in 1930.

GER_Clash_Of_The_Militias_desc:0 "The militias of the Anti-Spartacist alliance have become staunch rivals. The Sturmabeiltung, our personal militia, have expanded massively since Operation Hummingbird. The increasingly radical leader of the SA, Ernst Rohm, is advocating the destruction of all "medieval" structures and the establishment of a Futurist, Spartan state. This view has made them increasingly rowdy, rapacious, and worst, disloyal to the Reichsmarshall. Rohm especially is becoming a major threat.\n\nThe second problem is the Freikorps. Formed as a reactionary, nationalist organization in the wake of Luxemburg's abortive revolution, they fought side by side with the Wehrmacht and SA against her partisans. After the death of their political supporters in Operation Hummingbird, they were theoretically integrated with the Wehrmacht, but their reactionary, Volkisch nature was maintained. Led by August von Mackensen, they are on the outs with the regime but might be persuaded to rally it - if the SA are removed. While the SA think of the Freikorps as reactionary traitors - and they may be, given the recent Fuhrerdammerung - the Freikorps consider the SA lowborn wretches as bad as the Spartacists. What's more, the Freikorps has strong Wehrmacht support, and angering one will anger the other."

Let me summarize, shall I?"\n\nThe aide looked offended but could hardly say anything. Goering resumed:\n\n"First, we agree not to interfere with Protestant education, as long as you allow the incorporation of ideas designed to encourage loyalty and patriotism." No one could mistake the meaning of the last part.\n\n"Second, we agree to not persecute your followers, like the previous government had, if you accept that toleration of all beliefs is here to stay." More than one priest looked down sadly at this, but they all nodded after a second.\n\n"Third, you accept the total supremacy of the state in temporal matters, and we accept your authority, to a limited extent, in spiritual matters." The priests nodded again, accepting that the old times were dead.\n\n"So glad to hear you agree!" Goering shouted, in a tone in marked contrast to the menacing airs he put on during negotiations.

 GER_goering_internal_stabilization.1.d:0 "Since Reichskanzler Bismarck and the Volkisch coalition overthrew the monarchy, the occultist Nordicist group was running the country. They promised a great Germany, restoring the glory we had during the fall of the Roman Empire. Together with the descendants of Rome, we fought the traitors, to reclaim Germany. But they failed us. We were betrayed by our allies, but also betrayed by the Volkisch, who lacked the will to see the deed done. Nevertheless, the Reichsmarshall's followers allowed the Volkisch to persist, and supported them when Luxemburg's criminal reds tried to run Germany into the ground. But after the reds were broken, the Volkisch were a liability to Germany. Their leaders were granted the dignity of being shot, their organizations broken and exiled. \n\n The Volkisch mostly seem to have good intentions, even if they lack the ability to fight in the best way for Germany, being overly focused on pagan pursuits that distract from unification. We will likely be able to reconcile with most of them, invite them back to Germany, and put them to work energizing the nation, though they will have to be watched of course. But they are a threat with significant popular following, and reactionary elements among the Wehrmacht and Freikorps despise them. An alternative answer, therefore, is allowing the Protestant Church, who the Volkisch suppressed, a role subordinate to the state in German life. The values of discipline and honesty may be more natural to many Germans than the Nordicist beliefs of the Volkisch. Which faction should we back?"

 GER_austrian_ethnic_revolts.2.d:0 "[GetLeaderLastName] had always loved planes. He had made his name flying, and the Luftwaffe would always be his pride and joy. It was something of a disappointment when he stepped off along with the Abwehr chief, Wilhelm Canaris. Mussolini, wearing his trademark eagle cap, walked up to them. "Buongiorno, Signore [GetLeaderLastName]!" [GetLeaderLastName] inwardly seethed: this Italian had the nerve to make the translator do work? But he checked himself, Mussolini after all had been the Vaterland's one faithful ally for all these years. Canaris saluted Mussolini, and in they went. \n\nMussolini said, "Let's get down to business," and in came a Italian general. "General Badoglio, Herr [GetLeaderLastName]," he said, casting Mussolini a glance of utter loathing that [GetLeaderLastName] was sure the Duce didn't see. So he's a traditionalist, [GetLeaderLastName] thought, but at least he had the decency to call me Herr. Canaris and Badoglio began to explain the plan. "Our current contacts," said Canaris, "are a group known as the Associazione Nationalista Italiana, or the ANI. They are a group with long contacts to the Duce, working to subvert both the Austrians and the mad anarchists." [GetLeaderLastName] chuckled. He had heard Canaris' rants about the anarchists from Young Italy and couldn't believe it, how could a bunch of fools and fanatics ever hope to destroy Austria without even a government? Badoglio, picking up on this, said, "Herr [GetLeaderLastName], I know it is hard to believe but the anarchists are so popular that they are almost as great a threat as the Austrians, and certainly stronger than our allies. If you don't believe me, look at the Spartacists." The point hit home, [GetLeaderLastName] knew better than most that fooling people was an easy business. \n\n"What is your plan, Signore?" he asked. Badoglio replied, "At the predetermined moment, ANI insurgencies will begin across the countryside. Ideally they should tie down the Austrian armies, allowing us to break their line and relieve the ANI rebels. Once the Austrian defences break, perhaps they will be forced to retreat, and it will be the beginning of the end." Neither officer looked optimistic about the latter statement, but Mussolini looked very pleased. "See, Reichsmarshall?" he exclaimed excitedly. "We will break the Austrians with a swift blow, and then revenge shall be ours! \n\n"Thank you, Duce, but what is our role in all this?" Canaris replied. "We are to supply guns and ammunition, as well as launch a simultaneous attack to ensure that the Italian positions cannot be reinforced by Austria." [GetLeaderLastName] thought about this. He knew the generals had complained about sending equipment to their allies. And he knew that many German soldiers were unable to fight effectively for lack of weapons. But on the off chance that the plan worked, he had to try it. Anything less would anger the Italian allies, who had remained loyal. "Alright, that sounds good. What we need most, though, is a name. And I have an idea, based on old history.""

This ceremony was about crowning him the new Karl, which, he smugly admitted to himself, was not inaccurate. But would they want another war? And, barring the abhorrent possibility of the Volkisch being correct, he would die eventually. If he died, would Germany descend into anarchy? And how long could the hegemony last?\n\nHe brushed aside these thoughts. The hegemony, with true Germans in charge, would last for 1000 years. Of course it would. And he would appoint his successor at some point, it wasn't like he was going to die anytime soon. He decided to stop thinking. The time had come to be bold and strong, as the paragon of the Aryan race! He stepped out, basking in the adulation of the German crowds - now here were true Germans!\n\n"Men of the fatherland!" he shouted. "We have conquered, together, Europe. It is German now, forever! Not since Karl the Great have we ruled so much land, as is our birthright." The crowd took up the cry. "Long live [GetLeaderLastName], the new Karl!"\n\n"But," he said, after the cheering died down, "we must not stop here! We must not stop until all of our birthright is claimed and held! The lands of the west, our old brothers in France and our traitor brothers in Austria, still resist the will of Germany! We must never allow this, we must break them! The lands of the east, where the great Slavic enemy resides! Home of liberalism now! They must submit, and our birthright must be whole! Stand up, soldiers! Stand up, workers and wives! Do not lay down your burden until Germany is free!" The crowd cheered, and, thunderously, "Sieg heil!" Again and again. [GetLeaderLastName] allowed himself a grin. Yes, Germany would live forever."

GER_goering_post_unification.2.t:0 "Intrusion of Reality"
GER_goering_post_unification.2.d:0 "The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht was holding a meeting, and Feldmarschall Erich von Manstein was invited. Exiting his staff car, he admired the day for a moment. It was a sunny day, with flowers growing all around the barracks. No sign of the war that had consumed Germany for the past years, except the guards swarming the building. After checking in, the marshal entered the room to find his fellow commanders deep in a heated discussion.\n\n"Goering hasn't answered any summons over the past few weeks!" General Guderian exclaimed. Across from him, a furious Artur Axmann yelled, "How dare you criticize the Fuhrer! You and the indolent reactionaries of the officer corps should be shot for treason! The Fuhrer is fine, and he is the only leader of the Aryan race!" The meeting was dissolving before Manstein's eyes. Slamming a fist on the table, he barked, "Gentlemen!" Guderian and Axmann shut up, though even Manstein, soldier though he was, could see the hatred boiling in their eyes.\n\n"We convened to discuss the mutinies in the eastern armies with the Fuhrer. Where is he?" Manstein demanded. Just at that moment, a man rushed in. But it was not the Fuhrer, but his aide - Fritz, Manstein recalled. Fritz saluted sharply, then handed a note to Manstein. As he scanned down the note, he grew more and more shocked and alarmed. His face betrayed his usual stoicism, and he saw how disturbed the junior officers were to see this. The note was not dictated by Goering, but written by Fritz, and it made scandalous accusations about the Fuhrer - supposedly he had become addicted to morphine. Manstein read the last lines with even greater fear - "the Fuhrer has refused all treatment and is addicted, but is becoming sick. I secretly consulted a doctor, who informed me that the Fuhrer could go into cardiac arrest any moment. Do not tell anyone who wrote this letter." He cut off the name of the writer, then summarized the note's content for the audience.\n\nThe reaction was absolute chaos filling the room. The mutinies were immediately forgotten. The junior officers, many aligned with Axmann, demanded the name of the writer, which Manstein stubbornly refused to give. Guderian and his supporters demanded an intervention, but they couldn't convince enough of the officers to go along with it, causing Manstein to order Guderian to stop. In the end, little came of the meeting itself, but two meetings shortly after would decide the fate of Germany.\n\nManstein stopped Guderian past the door to the barracks. "General," he began, "there is merit to your planned intervention. While the Fuhrer's condition remains stable now, if it were to become unstable or … worse, measures may be taken to save Germany." Guderian stared at him, then nodded. "I'll draw up the plans," he said briefly, and entered his car. Just a few meters away, Artur Axmann was talking with officers of the Adlerjugend. "Soldiers of Germany, I'll be brief. The Fuhrer is our rightful leader, but it seems our colleagues in the Wehrmacht seek to betray him! This will not stand!" he said, in a frenzied rush. "Make plans to protect Germany from them, at all costs."\n\nAnother messenger rushed into the courtyard, saluting. "The Fuhrer is in critical condition." Manstein and Axmann nodded to their allies."

He conquered Western Europe, faced by threats from all sides. But when he perished, his heirs destroyed his kingdom. It would take Otto the Great to restore his empire, and it would never be the same.\n\nNapoleon. The greatest conqueror of the Age of Revolutions. He conquered all Europe at one point. But through the failures of his subordinates, his ambitions failed. And his subordinates forced him to bend to his enemies in 1814. Yet another great empire, felled not by its chief, but his subordinates and heirs.\n\nGoring thought about himself as the haze deepened. He could see out of the corner of his eye the doctor coming back. He saw Marshal Manstein, his friend Artur Axmann, his wife Emmy. He wondered what would happen to his empire, in a moment of lucidity. He could only hope that it wasn't torn apart, or subdued by its enemies. But that was for someone else now.

 GER_goering_internal_stabilization.3.t:0 "Containing the Militias"
 GER_goering_internal_stabilization.3.d:0 " The militias of the Anti-Spartacist alliance have become staunch rivals. The Sturmabeiltung, our personal militia, have expanded massively since Operation Hummingbird. The increasingly radical leader of the SA, Ernst Rohm, is advocating the destruction of all "medieval" structures and the establishment of a Futurist, Spartan state. This view has made them increasingly rowdy, rapacious, and worst, disloyal to the Reichsmarshall. Rohm especially is becoming a major threat.\n The second problem is the Freikorps. Formed as a reactionary, nationalist organization in the wake of Luxemburg's abortive revolution, they fought side by side with the Wehrmacht and SA against her partisans. After the death of their political supporters in Operation Hummingbird, they were theoretically integrated with the Wehrmacht, but their reactionary, Volkisch nature was maintained. Led by August von Mackensen, they are on the outs with the regime but might be persuaded to really it - if the SA are removed. While the SA think of the Freikorps as reactionary traitors - and they may be, given the recent Fuhrerdammerung - the Freikorps consider the SA lowborn wretches as bad as the Spartacists. What's more, the Freikorps has strong Wehrmacht support, and angering one will anger the other. \n Waiting will only anger both, so we must destroy one to appease the other. Herr Reichsmarshall, who shall we destroy?"
