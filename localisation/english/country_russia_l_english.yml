 KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky is the quintessential radical democrat. Having joined the republican-leaning left wing Turdoviks, he moderated his tone after the Tsar gave the Duma significant power, deciding that a powerless Tsar was no different than not having one. With the rise of the Workers Movement, support for Kerensky, a social democrat, grew, and he won election to the prime ministership in the VI State Duma. He has been in this office since, making Russia into a republic in all but name and preventing a Bolshevik takeover. His government, comprised of liberal and social democrats has held together, but has become increasingly divided over the future of Russia. Kerensky’s support has dwindled in free-market liberal circles for his social programs, and it remains to be seen whether his ideal of a democratic republic for the people will stand the test of time."
 PAVEL_DESC:0 "Pavel Milyukov is the leader of Russia's 2nd most powerful, popular and largest party in all of Russia, the Constitutional Democratic Party. He is a firm believer in a people first, and more controversially, a Greater Russian idea. Being a Russian irredentist, Milyukov gains much leniency from the Black Hundreds, spared from their brutal wrath in Ukraine and Russia. Though Milyukov is a firm critic of the government and the staunch ultranationalism of the Black Hundredists, he himself still believes in the democratic process unlike some of his more skeptical opponents, those being Lenin and Trotsky especially. Despite this, Milyukov's democratic ideals and slight market-liberalism allows for his ability to grow the CDP's popularity amongst the people further, and especially among the free marketists within Russia's politics, as of their anti-Kerensky stance. Milyukov will continue to rise, and now as President, will lead Russia into a golden age of dominance and prosperity, right?"
BELOGUROV_DESC:0 "Nikolai Belogurov, the leader of the Right-Wing URP coalition, is a staunch Russian nationalist, Monarchist and, very very controversially, Orthodox Conservative and quite pro-despotism. Despite this, Belogurov has expressed he believes in the democratic system (to a certain extent), as well as espousing Russian ultranationalist beliefs and the belief in Russian spiritualism and the outlawing of anything deemed degenerate by the church and Tsar. Belogurov, though previously being a Russian noble and violent Tsarist, has reformed his party into a semi-democratic coalition, reforming the URP's doctrines and revoking his under the table deals and alliances with groups that are considered being near terrorist organizations, more so the Okhrana remnants and Balck Hundredists. Belogurov's rise in power and wash over of Right-Wing nationalism suprised much of Russia, but with his newly found strong supporter base, has been able to garner the Presidency, though by a slim margin, will continue to lead Russia for the next term, or maybe, that term will never come as critics state, calling him a despot, monarchist puppet. Nevertheless, Belogurov definitely has something in store for Russia.."
LENIN_DESC:0 "Vladimir Lenin is the envy of all those radical among the left. He stands as a pillar of pro-Working Class, anti-establishment and leftist doctrine. Having been one of the original members of the RSDLP during his voluntary exile, is one of the most powerful figures of the RSDLP, and is inching towards the near tear in the RSDLP. His position of attempting total dominance over the RSDLP has led him to being viewed as a power hungry figure by many, and has always been a firm critic of the monarchy, Kerensky, and all parties that of his own, and especially his rival to control over the RSDLP, Tsereteli. For now, the RSDLP remains unified, but it's quite possible a tear could be caused soon. Lenin is an incredibly smart fellow among Russian politicans, but his populist motives and anti-government sentiment has set him back among upper class officials and many factory workers fed up with larger parties lying directly to the workers. Lenin, however, is ready to lead Russia into a brighter, more red future."
 RUSSIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1878, we Russians helped our Orthodox brethren liberate themselves from Ottoman tyranny. But the failures of the Tsar to win the Eastern War against the Japanese caused a Revolution in 1905. The Constitution of 1905 effectively surrendered most of the Tsar’s power, included labor rights, and ensured democracy. In 1914, Russia entered the Europakrieg against Austria, but pulled out due to political instability caused by President Martov's assasination.\nRussian politics have been harmonious under Martov's Successor, Alexander Kerensky, and the East, not the West, is now the bastion of democracy. Long live Russia, united and free!"

In addition, Byelorussians are in conflict over land in the Baltic Confederation, with Lithuanians who make up a small minority within Byelorussia. They have seen themselves to be subject to brutal pogroms, killings and lynchings of the 'disgusting' and 'heretical Lithuanian catholics'.

Many of these groups seek to preserve the Russian democracy as is, and some seek radical reform in an attempt to socialize and revitalize the country. Most leftists support the Trudovik Party and the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), despite the party having no real leadership and the 2 main candidates for President being both Lenin and Tsereteli. These lot are much more popular than the followers of Marx and Trotsky, and the Conservatives and the Russonationalists of the Russian alt-right. If we choose to support the democratic groups of the left we will have a choice between the three major parties of the left. The Social Democrats that are the Trudoviks, or "Martov Worshippers" as referred to by opposition parties. The Constitutional Democratic Party, are those who support a democracy close to the democracy of Great Britain, a liberalist consitutional democracy where the royalty are nothing but figureheads. And the RSDLP, being heavy prohibitionists and supporters of an industrialized Russia and an industrialized Siberia, wanting radical economic and social change as well as a reconstruction of the military's systems and policies put in place by Kerensky and the President before him, Martov.\n\nThen we have the democratic right, with the United Orthodox Conservative Front (UOCF), and many other much smaller parties, forming the bulk of the democratic Russian right wing groups, or possibly the more progressive traditionalist group, the Pravaya Svoboda (Right Liberty, PS) a more libertarian and republican party, supporting the rights of Russians, yet have some anti-Ukrainian sentiment, but seem to be on the good side of the Don and Kubanian cossacks. Or possibly the much more radicalist Right Wing, the Black Hundredists who believe in empowering the Russian monarchy and forming a fascist Russocentric, anti-Ukrainian and anti-Semetism, by far the largest of the Radicalist and Right Wing groups, having fought on Khreshchatyk against the Bolsheviks and RSDLP, resulting in a heavy victory for their assault divisions and armed wings, with many Bolsheviks being stabbed or killed.\n\nWhich will we choose?"

Suddenly, a tall man, in his 40s, approached Kozhkov.\n\n“Kozhkov? Is that you?” He immediately recognized the voice. “Sir Brezhnev?” “Why, Indeed my boy.” Brezhnev was a 45 year old man, who also served as Kozhkov’s teacher and helped him find a job. “This is strange, why are you doing this? Shouldn’t you be manning the store I helped you find a job in?” “Yes sir, but a minor outbreak in the town forced the store to close down until further notice, and I needed some money, so I am doing this.” “Well, how much do they pay you?” “20 Roubles per 100 posters, sir.” A strange silence soon followed. “You know Kozhkov, I dislike the conservatives and the whole URP thing.” “Why is that, sir?” “Well, you’d know if you were alive during the Tsarist autocracy.” Another moment of silence. “So, Kozhkov, do you know about that one Greek-American author, uhh, Obamitavian Barackus?” “No sir, I don’t get to read books often.”\n\n“Ah well, since you don’t know about it, it’s titled ‘2020 USA Elections’, it is the competition between two people for president-ship, Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The Latter one was the president, a very racist man with an undying hate for Mex-” “Did I just hear 2020 USA Elections?” A voice came from behind the two men. “Good day, gentlemen, my name is Allen Smith.” The young man spoke broken Russian, barely understandable. “I see that you two were talking about that novel?” “Indeed, good sir, we were.” replied Brezhnev. “Yes, you see, I am a painter, and whenever I sense an opportunity, I paint. I was American, but came here to Russia to admire this great nation. Now, if you would notice, Mr. Belogurov in this painting looks a lot like Donald Trump for the novel, and this slogan, ‘Make Russia Great Again’ sounds like the slogan that Trump used. So, I will do something that will make you both crack up super hard, after all, making people happy is my job!” Both of them looked with awe, as the man took out orange and yellow paint, and began to paint his hair in the mixture of the two colours. He painted a tuxedo onto him and some dead Hispanics in the background. All of them started to laugh their asses off. “Oi, what are you all doing? Sabotaging Election Campaign Posters?” A soldier, probably from law enforcement, had arrived. “N-No Mister,” said Allen. “Then DISPERSE, DAMMIT!” “Yes Mister, just give me a minute.” said Brezhnev, giving a paper to Kozhkov, “Take this to the school, and just say that you want a job as a peon or intern.” “Th-Thankyou Sir!” “DISPERSE! I AM NOT AFRAID TO SHOOT!” Following the orders given to them by the soldier, they dispersed, waving their farewells to each other. The soldier looked at the poster and chuckled to himself.

Undeniably, internal dissent and opposition remains in the young leftist republic. In fact the disunity that still exists between the old guard and the newly empowered socialists is more than visible. This is a misstep which the government unquestionably wants to correct, swiftly that is.\n\nThe establishment of the Cheka means one thing. Soon, every opponent of the regime would feel the tremor of the gavel on the desks of the enthusiastic socialist judges and the power of the bayonets granted to the soldiers of the freshly equipped Russian Army, directly in their flesh. Still a question remains, will this establishment ease or encourage dissent?"

No one is safe, Political Enemies, Soldiers and even Generals. It will all be delicately crafted to seem like a neat little accident.\n\n11 P.M, and most of Russia is asleep at this point. The first few operations began in major cities all over Russia. Newspaper Panels all over Moscow and St. Petersburg was raided by the police, and most employees arrested or killed. Many soldiers and officers stationed in major cities were also lured in, and killed in a “friendly-fire incident”. Then, the Okhrana made their way to the smaller towns and cities. It was probably by chance, but, on their way to Rostov, they saw Semyon Budoyonny attempting to escape. After a period of a brief and awkward silence, when the two parties ran into each other, Budyonny tried to run away but was quickly interrupted when shrapnel pierced his brain. With a small lamp in hand, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, who knew that he was on the list, was travelling with some armed men to escape to Siberia. Little did he know, his oh-so loyal soldiers were in fact, Okhrana double agents. After the youngest one gave the signal, the deed was done right there, on the streets of Omsk.  The “New Napoleon” has met his Waterloo. The killings continued, with many MANY more dying, hour after hour. The Okhrana hunted for traitors in the snow in vicious ways, killing thousands of men. At 5 A.M, when all the traitors on the “List” were dead, the Tsar finally ordered the end of the Purge."

After the purge had concluded, even some members of the Okhrana and their families were killed, to keep this operation as secretive as possible.\n\nYeren Issaivesky was a young soldier. He was about to turn 21 this year, however, he thought of everything he did till this point. In the “Name of the Tsar”, he killed many, MANY people. If it were a war, he would probably think differently, but the people who he murdered were all his brothers and sisters, fellow Russians. He tried to cope with it, he tried very hard to do so but, the faces of all the people he purposely murdered were haunting him, not letting him sleep. Then he thought of the solution for this problem. He was stationed near Finland, and asked his Company Commander to let him get out of their tent. That wish was granted. No one was around. He took out a small pistol out of his pocket and opened his mouth. The sound of a gunshot echoed. He could not bear it, so he decided to end it all. This however, wasn't the case with only Issaivesky, but many other men and recent conscripts, who could not bear to see so much death. Even though the purge has ended, its scars shall forever be imprinted on its perpetrators."

"I am hooked." Belgurov started to describe his proposal to the Tsar. After the Tsar’s abdication, his popularity plummeted. If they attempt to restore the Tsarist Autocracy to its fullest extent, it will most definitely lead to protests and violence all across the Nation. So, Belogurov proposed a new system. The Tsar would slowly be given power over politics of Russia. Starting with an increased influence over the Parliament and eventually restoring Autocratic Rule. This is a move, so that the Tsar’s image is not tarnished. The Tsar, having no other option, agreed with Belogurov and now, when he offered vodka to the Politician, he gladly accepted.

One such foul filth was the Communist Manifesto, published in 1848 by the Germans, Karl Marx and Fredreich Engels. It’s effect on the people was like a hypnotic trance. The dreams of a "perfect" society, where illiterate workers control everything and the people followed this flawed theory like sheep follow a sheepherder.\n\nIn Russia, the influence of this scum was huge. Large Socialist groups had been popping up ever since the reign of Nicholas I. In 1898, a young intelligent man, going by the name, Vladimir Lenin read the Communist Manifesto. Ever since then, he made any and every attempt to disrupt the Tsar and incite revolution. His brother tried to assassinate the Tsar and many more things. Upon the Tsar’s forced abdication during the 1905 Revolution and the ascension of the Republican Government, he tried his hardest in making RSDLP win the elections, even with unfair tactics. Fortunately, he never succeeded in achieving that, but after his bitter defeat in the Duma Elections, he has obtained a reason to rally people behind him, to cause general unrest. However, considering the state of the RSDLP, it is foolish to assume that he will be taking any major steps.

Without a moment’s delay, he rushed to the nearest window and attempted to jump out, before he realized he was shot in the leg. A Cossack came up to him, and grabbed him by his collar, he started begging for mercy.

"Yes Sir, Trotsky and his followers are able to publish and print their newspapers, somewhere around here." "You know your punishment if you are lying, right?" "Yes Sir, execution before the public, but rest assured, I am not lying." "In that case, have these'', he said as he handed him 2 pieces of paper over.

The Tsar however, needs no one dead, If I see you both shoot anyone, I will shoot you both myself, Got it?" "Yessir!" The Tsar however, never said this. The Commissioner had some humanity left in him, and he would not kill anyone just for the heck of it. 30 Minutes Later, the three men gathered, during the chilly winds of everything beyond the Urals and boarded their horses. They started making their way towards the place marked by Ulyanov on the map. On their way there, Sergey explained his plan. "Listen up, Vladimir, you deal with the bottom floor, do not shoot ANYONE, and Irkirov, you deal help me find him, but the same applies to you." When they reached the outskirts of the building, they busted in. "HANDS UP AND SURRENDER TO US AND NO ONE WILL BE HURT!" Sergey screamed as he shot his pistol on the ceiling. Vladimir went to evacuate all personnels out, and Irkirov and Sergey rushed to the first floor, where they frantically searched all doors, evacuating the staff in the process. Eventually, they found a room labelled, "Chairman’s Office" they busted in and saw Trotsky putting a revolver inside you mouth. "OH NO YOU DON’T" as Sergey rushed forward and knocked the pistol out of his hand. He signalled for Irkirov to evacuate the rest of the staff which he proceeded to do. Trotsky shouted, "KILL ME, DON'T TAKE ME THERE, I BEG YOU" "The Tsar wants you alive, and he shall have that!" as he knocked out Trotsky. He handcuffed the man and proceeded to exit the building. He saw the whole staff outside, without a single casualty. "You both have done well, I will be sure to get you both a promotion!" Both of them shared a smile and all three of them boarded her horses. However, the only thing going on in Sergey’s mind was, how many sleepless nights will he experience now? He only begged that the Lord would forgive him for this."

However, this all changed with the victory of Belogurov's Union of the Russian People. He was summoned to the VII Duma under executive orders of the President. Upon arrival, Belogurov and the other leaders of the Russian monarchist political groups greeted him. Entering the House of the Duma, he felt the nostalgia. The very same room the Duma  forced him to abdicate in. He had not seen the interior of the building since 1906. Not much had changed, excluding a podium. Belogurov gestured towards the ceremonial throne of the Tsar in the Duma. Nikolai sat in the chair as Belogurov made the preparations. At last, he stood up with the ushering in of the members of the Duma and the new government. Belogurov walked towards the Tsar, taking a knee and handing him his crown on the finest silk pillow. Nikolai took the crown, adorned it on his head. Nikolai made his speech to the Duma in private. Declaring a new era in Russian history, and granting upon himself the title of Emperor of Russia and Grand Duke of Finland. The Duma erupted into joy, the crowd chanting God Save the Tsar.

SOV_pavel_tree_events.1.d:0 "The date was September 18th, 1911. Pytor Stolyplin walked outside of the Kiyv Opera House with his wife after a riveting show of Tchiakovsky's Nutcracker. Little did he know these would be his last steps; outside stood Dmitry Bogrov, a proponent of violent revolution who acted simultaneously as a member of the Tsar's Secret Service, the Okhrana. Bogrov would fire the shot heard around the whole of Russia.\n\nAfter Stolyplin's assasination, Former President Martov cracked down on the Okhrana, with President Kerensky finally banning it once and for all. While the Okhrana was not completely destroyed after Kerensky's ban, it would remain in a state of deep division. Dmitry Bogrov had escaped from his prison cell and was now one of the leaders of the Okhrana, the head of the Savages Faction; Yegor Ivanka headed the Gallows faction, while many other smaller factions were scattered around the fringes of Russia. On the 31st of October 1923, the Gallowe Ball was called on an estate in Siberia by the leaders in hopes of solving the schism; however, in a shocking turn of events, Bogrov and his Savages assasinated the Gallows and other enemies. Bogrov himself disappeared after the ball, leaving many to believe he had been assasinated himself.\n\nAfter the ball, the Okhrana became a disorganized mess with no real leadership. That leads us to the present day. With the highly unstable situation of our nation, President Milyukov could use a powerful Okhrana to secure his rule...but at the cost of democracy. Recent intelligence shows Bogrov might be alive in hiding somewhere in Europe, and he might be the only hope for creating a powerful Okhrana once again.\n\nThe Duma is voting whether to allow the limited rearment of the Okhrana. Now we must choose what path we should take: should we unleash the beast over Russia, or preserve the democratic ideals that brought us our presidency?"

It read, "To the President of the United States, it is my dearest honor that I get to write to you. However, what I have written you this letter for is the desperate state of my homeland. My homeland is currently under attack by the Japanese, and thousands of men are dying everyday just to protect their fatherland. The Empire of Japan may have also been eyeing up US Territory in the Pacific. It is of utmost importance that we curb the influence of this evil empire. So, I request you, not as an Ambassador, but as a Russian whose nation is under attack, please assist us. I hope that you understand, and even small shipments of weapons will be beneficial to us. We will make sure to repay the glorious American Nation from what we can. Thankyou. -Signed, Boris Bakhmeteff''\nThe President walked to his room in the White House and he began to think about it.

The conflict further polarized an unstable Russian Republic."

 SOV_starting_events_pavel.1.d:0 "For too long, Russia has been under the strict control of the Trudovik government, with Kerensky imposing ridiculous policies like Prohibition and economic regulation. To let the common Russian man prosper, we must deregulate! Let the Russian drink his beer and let the free market thrive! Pavel Milyukov shall bring these policies to the table as President of Russia, bolstering the economy and freeing the people from the shackles plaaced by Kerensky."

It is questionable that trying to wipe out their presence in the RSDLP would represent an immense mistake. Instead of undermining their existence in the party, it is for our shared interest that we should try to negotiate with the leaders of the Tsertelli and try to find a common ground between our policies. Undeniably some compromises with our methods will be required to do so, but it is a sacrifice that we are ready to make."
